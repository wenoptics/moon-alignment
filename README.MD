# Moon Extractor

## What is it?

A tool that helps you to batch processing the moon photographs you took.

## How to use?

Simply run `python crop.py`


## How does it work?

The project uses OpenCV (Python-binding) to locate the moon region on
photo, then extract the moon and perform some post-processing (cropping,
padding, resizing, etc),


## What's your motivation...?

It's **the super blue blood wolf moon** on January 31st 2018. On that day, I,
together with my dad took about 300-400 photos of the moon, basically covered the
entire process of the lunar eclipse. And the following day I thought about how
to make fun use of these abundant photos we took (on a cold winter night),
other than just pick two or three of them and *do some Photoshop*.

I thought about making a time-lapsed video, hoping to present this spectacular
event in dozens of seconds. This video, very short though, required the
moon to be aligned between frames
